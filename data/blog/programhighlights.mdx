# Statistics and Data Science MS GIDP Highlights

## Qualifying Exam

The Statistics and Data Science Qualifying Exam is comprised of a Theory section and a Methodology section.  Each section has six problems, and students select 5 to answer. The exams were held August $3^{rd}$ and $4^{th}$, 2023. I received **PhD Pass** on the Methodology portion of the exam, and **MS Pass** Theory portion.  Below are some reference materials that I created as reference for the exams.

#### Theory

A reference notebook for various distributions and their related distributions, general applications, and pertinent properties for theoretical analysis.

Additional miscellaneous reference useful in Statistical theory problems and appilcations.

## Fall 2022 / Spring 2023

### Statistical DOE

For my Statistical Design of Experiments course final project, I performed a $2^k$ factorial design experiment using three different free throw shooting technique factors for anlaysis. Surprisingly, I found that bending my legs and using a “spring” motion affected my shot with statistical significance.  Here is a blog-style summary of the project, the results, and some other insights.

## Fall 2023

### Machine Learning and NBA Statistics

My Statistical Machine Learning final project used a dataset of all active NBA players' individual game statlines (including advanced stats) that I assembled queueing from the NBA API via Python. The data was used to train classification models that can predict a player's position (PG, SG, SF, PF, C) from an input statline.

</div>

The project covers different approaches to the model, what model gives the best predictions, and what is most efficient. This simple novelty analysis may not have immediate practical applications, but has been invaluable to give me the framework for future analyses of NBA data that can be refreshed with the latest statistics.

### Decision Analysis

An original exercise in the detailed decision analysis of a major decision affecting all Engineering directorates of a major corporation.

</div>

The project details extensive analysis that a company faces with selecting a new corporate standard electrical design tool. It uses decision analysis techniques such as value modeling, decision trees, risk assessment, and other Engineering decision techniques to provide the objectively best recommendation to the decision maker based upon available data.
