summary: A litte more about who I am...
---

I was originally born in Torrance, CA, but at the ripe young age of...a few months old...my family moved to Flagstaff, Arizona. It was a great town grow up in, with snowy winters and mild summers set to the backdrop of ponderosa pine tree forests. Flag is a small "everbody knows everbody" kind of town, and I'm grateful to still be in close contact with many of my friends I grew up with from home.

In 2006 I graduated from Flagstaff High School and began my undergraduate studies at the University of Arizona. My studies began in Applied Mathematics, and I ultimately graduated Cum Laude in 2011 with a BS in Engineering Mathematics.

After college I took some time off, and after a small stint in Los Angeles ([I have an IMDB page to show for it](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4754897/)), I moved to Portland, Oregon in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.  I started my professional career here as an Engineer at Daimler Trucks North America, working in both electrical and mechanical engineering disciplines for Freightliner and Western Star product lines.

I moved back to Tucson in 2018, and today I am back at the University of Arizona
pursuing my MS in the [Statistics and Data Science Graduate Interdisciplinary Program (GIDP)](https://statistics.arizona.edu/).


## In my own time I really enjoy...

### Music

<PhotosSwiperMusic />

Most of the credit for my musicianship goes to my father, who played piano around me growing up. He gifted me a guitar when I was young, and I have since played for 21 years.  Since high school I have regularly played in groups; when I was in undergrad, I was in a group which released [an album](https://music.apple.com/us/album/el-mixo/377336615) in 2010.  Most recently, I play in a local Tucson group [Never On Time](https://www.facebook.com/Neverontime2019/). Inspired by my father's playing, I picked up piano about two years ago, which has been a fun and rewarding experience.

### Photography

<PhotosSwiperPhotography />

My mother is a longtime photographer and I have been fortunate to be able to use her old equipment! Her Minolta SRT-101 and X100 film cameras have been especially fun hand-me-downs to get to use. In an age of point-and-shoot digital photography with your cell phone, shooting film has been an especially fun hobby to pick up. Being forced to be thoughtful, deliberate, and purposeful with your shots with a film camera has helped me to approach other facets of my life in the same ways.

## Kayaking

Whenever I can, I love to hit the river for some whitewater adventures! My father turned me onto the sport when I was a teenager and since then I have been hooked. We try and do a father-son trip each summer, and they are always special!
Over the years we have run the Rogue River in Oregon, the Middle Fork and Main Salmon Rivers in northern Idaho, and a truly unforgettable and classic trip down the Grand Canyon from Lee's Ferry to Diamond Creek.

## My Cat

*Mija!*

She is my best furry friend. She's about five years old and a delight to have around. Growing up, my grandmother (a first generation American from Mexico) would refer to all of the grandchildren as Mijo and Mija (nothing unusual there). Mija will always remind me of her and just like it means, she's my little girl.


## Sports

If you perused my academic work samples, you may have noticed that I like basketball. I love all kinds of sports, but basketball is my favorite sport, and the University of Arizona Men's Basketball team is my favorite team of my favorite sport. I live near campus and am so lucky to be able to just walk to games! It really is a dream come true for me. McKale is the best arena on earth.

I have now been in Tucson long enough (over a decade total) to truly call it home. Having been all over the world, there is still no place I have been quite like it. The Sonoran Desert is an incredible place to be.

I am proud to be a part of the University of Arizona, both as a current student and alumni. I bleed red and blue!

And of course, BEAR DOWN!!!
