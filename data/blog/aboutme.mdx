summary: A litte more about who I am...
---

I was originally born in Torrance, CA, but at the ripe young age of...a few months old...my family moved to Flagstaff, Arizona. It was a great town grow up in, with snowy winters and mild summers set to the backdrop of ponderosa pine tree forests. Flag is a small "everbody knows everbody" kind of town, and I'm grateful to still be in close contact with many of my friends I grew up with from home.

In 2006 I graduated from Flagstaff High School and began my undergraduate studies at the University of Arizona. My studies began in Applied Mathematics, and I ultimately graduated Cum Laude in 2011 with a BS in Engineering Mathematics.

After college I took some time off, and after a small stint in Los Angeles ([I have an IMDB page to show for it!](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4754897/)), I moved to Portland, Oregon in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.  I started my professional career here as an Engineer at Daimler Trucks North America, working in both electrical and mechanical engineering disciplines for Freightliner and Western Star product lines.

I moved back to Tucson in 2018, and today I am back at the University of Arizona
pursuing my MS in the [Statistics and Data Science Graduate Interdisciplinary Program (GIDP)](https://statistics.arizona.edu/).


## In my own time I really enjoy...

### Music

<PhotosSwiperMusic />

Most of the credit for my musicianship goes to my Dad, who played piano around me growing up...I sincerely believed it help program my musical ear. When I was about 7 he gifted me a guitar, and the rest is history...I have since played for 21 years.  

Since high school I have regularly played in groups; when I was in undergrad, I was in a group which released [an album](https://music.apple.com/us/album/el-mixo/377336615) in 2010.  Most recently, I play in a local Tucson group [Never On Time](https://www.facebook.com/Neverontime2019/). Inspired by Dad's playing, I picked up piano about two years ago, which has been an absolute blast to pick up and has really changed the way I think about playing and composition.

I also do a fair amount recording in my home studio, and hope to release some music soon. This summer I have been creating some ambient/meditative tracks, and I will post a link somewhere on this site once I get them released (as well as anything else I eventually put out there).

### Photography

<PhotosSwiperPhotography />

My Mom is a longtime photographer and this time she gets the credit for getting me into photography. It's fun to look around you and see compositions, and I have really gotten a lot of enjoyment over the years of just pointing and shooting whenever/wherever I can.

She has also let me use her old equipment! Her Minolta SRT-101 and X100 film cameras have been especially fun hand-me-downs to play around with. In an age of point-and-shoot digital photography with your cell phone, shooting film has been especially fun...being forced to be thoughtful, deliberate, and purposeful with your shots is important when you're shooting film, and it has helped me to approach other facets of my life in the same ways.

## Kayaking, River Life, and the Outdoors

<PhotosSwiperOutdoors />

Having growing up in an outdoorsy town, I have been naturally inclined to enjoying getting outside. I of course enjoy a good hike or a camping adventure, but my favorite thing to do outside of the house is whitewater kayaking, and being on the river. It's the best of all worlds, and there is truly nothing that compares to the peaceful isolation of floating down a river for several days at a time.

My Dad got me into kayaking when I was a teenager (he's a solid boater himself ðŸ˜‰), and since then I have been hooked. I've been truly lucky to have such a unique activity that I get to do with him; we try and get a trip in any summer that we can.

Over the years we have run the Rogue River in Oregon, the Middle Fork and Main Salmon Rivers in northern Idaho, and a truly unforgettable and classic trip down the Grand Canyon from Lee's Ferry to Diamond Creek. I can't reccomend getting out on a river trip enough!

## My Cat

*Mija!*

She is my best furry friend. She's about five years old and a delight to have around. Growing up, my grandmother (a first generation American from Mexico) would refer to all of the grandchildren as Mijo and Mija (nothing unusual there). Mija will always remind me of her and just like it means, she's my little girl.


## Sports

If you perused my academic work samples, you may have noticed that I like basketball. I love all kinds of sports, but basketball is my favorite sport, and the University of Arizona Men's Basketball team is my favorite team of my favorite sport. I live near campus and am so lucky to be able to just walk to games! It really is a dream come true for me. McKale is the best arena on earth.

------

I have now been in Tucson long enough (over a decade total) to truly call it home. Having been all over the world, there is still no place I have been quite like it. The Sonoran Desert is an incredible place to be.

I am proud to be a part of the University of Arizona, both as a current student and alumni. I bleed red and blue!

And of course, BEAR DOWN!!!
