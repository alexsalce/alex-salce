I am a current student of University of Arizona's Statistics and Data Science Graduate Interdisciplinary program (GIDP), as well as a professional Engineer with over 10 years of experience in Electrical, Mechanical, and Systems Engineering. 

My interests in engineering are primarily in systems electrical design, but my first love is math. An engineer's purpose is to provide solutions to any challenges we may face, and I am looking forward to leveraging my skills in statistics, data science, and machine learning to finding sensible solutions to real world challenges.

You can find my profile on the [University of Arizona Statistics website](https://statistics.arizona.edu/person/alex-salce).
